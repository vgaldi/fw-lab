BioTag srl is an innovative startup company founded in 2022 as a partnership between [MANTID](/startup/mantid) srl and [IT Health Fusion](https://www.ithealthfusion.com) srl (Naples, Italy).

Its key mission is the design and development of innovative solutions for identifying, localizing and storing biological tissue samples in anatomical pathology laboratories. Typical marketed solutions, relying on optical scanners that read two-dimensional barcodes printed on hystological cassettes, are limited in terms of reliability and reading times.

BioTag srl has developed an alternative platform, which relies on a patented technology based on radio-frequency-identification (RFID) that overcomes the above limitations, thereby enabling a fast and reliable process. The proposed platform has been successfully validated in hospital trials at the [Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS “Fondazione G. Pascale” (INT – Pascale)](https://newportal.istitutotumori.na.it) -- the largest clinical care and research cancer center in southern Italy.
