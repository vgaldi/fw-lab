**Michele Scaravilli** was born in Caserta, Italy, on December 9, 1988.

He received his M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering (*summa cum laude*) from the
["Federico II" University of Naples](http://www.unina.it/en_GB/home), Italy, with a thesis project
dealing with the design and optimization of an anti-intrusion microwave sensor based on a
parallel-plate waveguide with deformable walls. In 2018, he received the Ph.D. degree in Information Technologies for
Engineering​ from the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, defending a thesis on Bloch‐surface‐wave assisted lab‐on‐fiber optrodes,
supervised by Profs. [Vincenzo Galdi](/author/vincenzo-galdi)
and Andrea Cusano

From January to June 2018, he was as a postdoctoral researcher in Department of Engineering at the University of Sannio. His research activities were focused on the design, numerical modeling and fabrication of novel label-free optical fiber nanoprobes based
on the excitation of Bloch surface waves.

Since July 2018, he has been working as a product engineer at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com), Munich, Germany.
