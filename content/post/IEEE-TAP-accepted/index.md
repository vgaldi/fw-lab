Our paper on "Harnessing spectral singularities in non-Hermitian cylindrical structures," in collaboration with [Andrea Al√π](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/Core-Bios/Andrea-Alu) (ASRC-CUNY),
has been accepted for publication in the [*IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=8).

An [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01616) is available.
