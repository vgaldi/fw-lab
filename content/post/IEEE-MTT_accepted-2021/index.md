Our paper on "Surface-wave propagation on non-Hermitian metasurfaces with extreme anisotropy,"
in collaboration with [Andrea Al√π](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/Core-Bios/Andrea-Alu) (ASRC-CUNY),
has been accepted for publication in the [*IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques*](https://mtt.org/publications/transactions/). 

An [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06641) is available.
