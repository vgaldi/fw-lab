We have presented five papers on:

* ["Enhancement of weak nonlocality in aperiodically ordered multilayered dielectric metamaterials"](/publication/coppolaro-metamaterials-2019/)

* ["Some ideas for non-Hermitian doping of epsilon-near-zero media"](/publication/coppolaro-metamaterials-2019-b/)

* ["Nonlocal and non-Hermitian transformation optic"](/publication/moccia-metamaterials-2019/)

* ["Spectral singularities in non-Hermitian cylindrical geometries"](/publication/cmoccia-metamaterials-2019-b/)

* ["Space-time-coding digital metasurfaces"](/publication/zhang-metamaterials-2019/)

at the *13th International Congress on Engineered Material Platforms for Novel Wave Phenomena* ([Metamaterials]),
Rome, Italy, Sep. 16-19, 2019.
