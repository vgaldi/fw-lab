The call for nominations for the *2023 EurAAP Leopold B. Felsen Award for Excellence in Electrodynamics* is open.

The Award was originally established jointly by the University of Siena and the University of Sannio, funded through a donation from Michael and Judy Felsen in fulfillment of the last wishes of their father, Professor Leo Felsen (1924-2005). Since 2015, the Award is established by the [European Association on Antennas and Propagation (EuRAAP)](https://www.euraap.org).

The main purpose of the Award is to keep alive Prof. Felsenâ€™s memory and scientific legacy, 
as well as to foster academic excellence in the electromagnetics community, 
by giving recognition to outstanding fundamental contributions from early stage researchers in electrodynamics.

The Award, by nomination only, is presented annually, as a career award, to an early-stage researcher. Eligible nominees should be under 40 years of age at the submission deadline; this age limit can be extended for documented career breaks (e.g., sick leaves, parental leaves). Previous awardees (also from the former Sannio and Siena editions) are not eligible.

The Award consists of a prize of 5,000 US$, which will be funded by the Felsen Family through a donation, 
and will be officially presented at the banquet of the upcoming 
[17th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation](http://www.eucap2023.org) (EuCAP 2023). 

Candidates from all areas of Electromagnetics are eligible to apply. 
Selection will be based on quality and significance of the candidates' contributions to the field, and on the 
recommendation of the referees.

The deadline for submission of the nominations is **January 31, 2023**.
