We have presented three invited talks on 

* [*"Some emerging concepts in the design of space-time-coding digital metasurfaces"*](/publication/zhang-metamaterials-2024/)

* [*"Time-switched metastructures: analysis and design of the anomalous radiative phenomena at time-interfaces"*](/publication/ramaccia-metamaterials-2024/)

* [*"Excitation of natural resonances in time-varying dispersive interfaces"*](/publication/rizza-metamaterials-2024/)

and two contributed talks on 

* [*"Artificial magnetism via Mie resonances"*](/publication/contestabile-metamaterials-2024/) 

* [*"Temporal interfaces in time-modulated metasurface for the excitation of space-time wave packets"*](/publication/stefanini-metamaterials-2024/) 

at the *18th International Congress on Engineered Material Platforms for Novel Wave Phenomena* ([Metamaterials]), Crete, Greece, Sep. 9-12, 2024.
