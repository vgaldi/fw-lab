We are currently offering multiple postdoctoral opportunities. We invite highly motivated candidates with strong backgrounds in electromagnetic modeling and computer-programming skills to apply for these positions.

Research topics:
1. **Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Explore the theoretical and practical aspects of geometry-driven magnetic metamaterials for MRI scanners operating at radio frequency (1H: 60-500 MHz, 1.5T-12T). This research aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and safety for MRI systems.
2. **Multi-resonant Metasurfaces for Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy**: Contribute to developing an advanced mid-infrared biosensing platform using multiresonant plasmonic metasurfaces. This platform will enable real-time, non-destructive, and highly sensitive analysis of proteins, peptides, and other biochemical species.
3. **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Smart Propagation Environments**: Join a collaborative effort to explore the potential of RIS technology for next-generation wireless communications. This interdisciplinary project combines electromagnetic modeling and design, signal processing, optimization tools, and information theory.

Position details:
- Full-time positions for one year, with possible extension.
- Expected starting time: fall 2023 or early 2024.
- Interested candidates should [submit](/contact/) their CV and three references, specifying their topic(s) of interest.
