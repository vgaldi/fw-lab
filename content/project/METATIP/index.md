The integration of metastructures with fiber-optics technology is a pivotal development for their practical and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. This fits naturally within the recently emerged "lab-on-fiber" paradigm, which envisions the integration of optical fibers with nanophotonic and/or nanoplasmonic platforms enabling for nanoscale control of light, thereby substantially expanding the functionalities of conventional and specialty fibers, with potential applications ranging from optical processing to environmental monitoring, life science, safety and security.

We have been exploring several configurations that integrate artificial (metallic or dielectric) nanostructures  on the tip of an optical fiber.
These include plasmonic metasurfaces and dielectric gratings, which can be tailored so as to excite surface waves on the fiber tip that can be exploited for label-free sensing applications.
