The simplest conceivable form of “order” in nature is that associated with periodicity. However, the discovery of “quasicrystals” in solid-state physics has triggered a growing interest in the study of *aperiodically ordered* structures in many branches of physics and engineering.

Though aperiodic, these geometries can still exhibit long-range order and high-order rotational symmetry not bound by the conventional crystallographic restrictions, and can cover the middle-ground separating perfect periodicity from complete randomness.

Our longstanding research activities in this field encompass the theoretical understanding of aperiodic-order-induced wave phenomena, as well as the modeling, engineering and experimental characterization of aperiodically ordered structures and devices of interest in a variety of applications. These include:
- Radiation and scattering;
- Bandgap and localization;
- Guided resonances;
- Enhanced nonlocal effects.
