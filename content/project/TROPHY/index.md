Transformation optics has been a pivotal catalyst in the remarkable advancements within the field of electromagnetic metamaterials, offering a systematic and flexible framework for designing artificial media with specific field manipulation capabilities. By leveraging the form-invariance of Maxwell’s equations under coordinate transformations, transformation optics enables precise tailoring of a material's spatial constitutive profile to control field distribution and propagation according to a distorted coordinate reference frame.

This approach represents a paradigm shift by decoupling the conceptual design from the actual material synthesis. The design process is primarily driven by geometrical intuition and considerations, while the synthesis involves approximating ideal constitutive "blueprints."

In our research, we have applied this methodology to develop various wave-transforming devices and have explored potential extensions to nonlocal, [non-Hermitian], multi-physics, and multifunctional scenarios.
