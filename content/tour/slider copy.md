  slides:
    - title: '**At the boundary of physics and engineering**'
      content: We study fundamental physical aspects of **wave propagation** in complex media and scenarios, and explore engineering applications to communications and sensing.

    - title: '**Complex materials**'
      content: 'We study artificial materials and **metamaterials** that can exhibit exotic properties not available in natural media. These include nonlocal, nonreciprocal, non-Hermitian, time-varying, and multi-physics responses.'
