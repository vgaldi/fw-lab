abstract: "This monograph contains the ceremonials and the Proceedings pertaining to the Workshop/Minisymposium on 'Electromagnetics in a Complex World: Challenges and Perspectives,' convened at the University of Sannio, Ben足evento, Italy, from February 20-21, 2003, in connection with the bestowal of an honorary Laurea degree on Professor Leopold B. Felsen. The symposium was co-organized by Professors Innocenzo M. Pinto and Vincenzo Galdi, in consul足tation with Professor Felsen. The University of Sannio is a recently installed fast-growing university enrolling about 6,500 undergraduate and graduate stu足dents in its various programs (Law, Economics, Engineering, Sciences). The College of Engineering presently comprises 50 faculty members and about 1,500 students. The degree bestowal ceremony took place in the morning of February 20, 2003, and is documented (in English) in its entirety here in Part VI of these Proceedings (because of the international character of this two-day event, the program booklet provided for attendees of the degree award ceremony was printed in Italian and English). After a brief greeting by Prof. Aniello Cimitile, the President of the University of Sannio, Professor Pinto, who had originally proposed Prof. Felsen's nomination, delivered (in Italian) a detailed Laudatio, a laudatory discourse on the nominee's accomplishments and per足 sonality. This was followed by the nominee's Lectio, a retrospective covering his professional life as well as his social and cultural background, presented (in English) in a mixed style laced with humor, and comprising prose, verses, visuals, and photographs."
