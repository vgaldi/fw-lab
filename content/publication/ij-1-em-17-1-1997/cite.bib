	abstract = {The Donsker-Kac formula can be adapted to compute the dominant eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in dielectric waveguides with complicated geometry, in the weak guidance approximation. The computation of the involved functional (path) integrals is accomplished by means of a reduced-variance Monte Carlo method. The method seems attractive by comparison with standard techniques (Moments Method and Finite Elements) in terms of computational budget. }
