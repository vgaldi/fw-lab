abstract = "We present a theoretical framework for analyzing aperiodically ordered photonic time quasicrystals (PTQCs), which are the temporal analogs of spatial photonic quasicrystals. Using a general two-symbol substitutional sequence to model temporal modulations, we extend the trace and antitrace map formalism used for spatial photonic quasicrystals to the temporal domain. Focusing on the Thue-Morse sequence as a representative example, we examine the band structure and wave-transport properties, discussing their physical origins and highlighting both similarities with and key differences from conventional periodic photonic time crystals. Furthermore, we investigate the peculiar features of PTQCs, such as multiscale spectral response and localization effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between aperiodic order and wave dynamics in time-varying media, highlighting its potential to enable the development of advanced photonic devices."
