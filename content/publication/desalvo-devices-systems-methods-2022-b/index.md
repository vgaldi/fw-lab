abstract: "The disclosed radar system may include a radar mechanism comprising a transmitter and at least one receiver. The radar system may also include a signal generator that generates a frequency-modulated radar signal. In addition, the radar system may include a delay mechanism that (1) receives the frequency-modulated radar signal from the signal generator and (2) after a certain period of delay, passes the frequency-modulated radar signal to the transmitter to be transmitted to a transponder located on a wearable artificial reality device. The radar system may also include a processing device that (1) receives the frequency-modulated radar signal from the signal generator, (2) detects a signal returned to the receiver from the transponder, and (3) calculates a distance between the transponder and the receiver based at least in part on an analysis of the signal returned from the transponder and the frequency-modulated radar signal received from the signal generator."
