abstract = "An object-based inverse scattering algorithm is presented for electromagnetic imaging of homogeneous dielectric targets in a lossless, homogeneous background. The proposed approach embodies the use of a contrast source inversion method in conjunction with a curve-evolution-based reconstruction technique, thereby integrating the attractive computational features of the former with the robustness and edge-preserving capabilities of the latter. Numerical results involving single- and double-target configurations are presented to validate the approach and demonstrate its capabilities."
