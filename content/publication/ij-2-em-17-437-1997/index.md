abstract = "A Wiener Integral approach to compute the scalar potential of transverse electromagnetic modes in complex (multiconductor) transmission lines and its application to characteristic impedance computation via stationary (variational) formulas are presented. The computation of the involved Wiener functional integrals is accomplished by means of Monte Carlo methods. "
