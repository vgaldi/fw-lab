abstract: "A system includes a locatable glove and a pose determination device. The locatable glove includes a glove body worn over a hand of a user, and a plurality of positioning transponders. The positioning transponders are coupled to the glove body at various positions on the glove body, and each re-radiates a received signal, the re-radiated signal unique to the positioning transponder. The pose determination device includes a plurality of antennas and a controller. The antennas are each configured to receive the unique signals re-radiated by the positioning transponders. The antennas are physically separated from each other. The controller is communicatively coupled to the plurality of antennas, and is configured to determine, for each of the received unique signals, a location of the position on the locatable glove of the positioning transponder corresponding to the unique signal."
