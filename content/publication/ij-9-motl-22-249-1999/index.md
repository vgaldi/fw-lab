abstract = "A systematic spectral-domain approach is described for obtaining higher order electromagnetic impedance boundary conditions for isotropic, longitudinally inhomogeneous, dielectric coatings on a polarization-preserving impedance plane. Representative computational examples including single- and two-layer inhomogeneous coatings are discussed to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approach."
