abstract = "The suggestive idea of “cloaking” an electromagnetic sensor, i.e., strongly reducing its visibility (scattering) while maintaining its field-sensing (absorption) capabilities, has recently been proposed in the literature, based on scattering-cancellation, Fano-resonance, or transformation-optics approaches. In this paper, we explore an alternative transformation-optics-based route, which relies on the recently introduced concept of “anti-cloaking.” More specifically, our proposed approach relies on a suitable tailoring of the competing cloaking and anti-cloaking mechanisms, interacting in a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario. Via analytical and parametric studies, we illustrate the underlying phenomenology, identify the critical design parameters, and address the relevant optimality and trade-off issues, taking also into account the effect of material losses. Our results confirm the envisaged potentials of the proposed transformation-optics approach as an attractive alternative route to sensor cloaking."
