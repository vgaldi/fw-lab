abstract = "The intriguing concept of “anti-cloaking” has been recently introduced within the framework of transformation optics (TO), first as a “countermeasure” to invisibility-cloaking (i.e., to restore the scattering response of a cloaked target), and more recently in connection with “sensor invisibility” (i.e., to strongly reduce the scattering response while maintaining the field-sensing capabilities). In this paper, we extend our previous studies, which were limited to a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario, to the three-dimensional spherical case. More specifically, via a generalized (coordinate-mapped) Mie-series approach, we derive a general analytical full-wave solution pertaining to plane-wave-excited configurations featuring a spherical object surrounded by a TO-based invisibility cloak coupled via a vacuum layer to an anti-cloak, and explore the various interactions of interest. With a number of selected examples, we illustrate the cloaking and field-restoring capabilities of various configurations, highlighting similarities and differences with respect to the cylindrical case, with special emphasis on sensor-cloaking scenarios and ideas for approximate implementations that require the use of double-positive media only."
