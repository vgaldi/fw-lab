 abstract = {A radar system may include (1) a wearable device, (2) a set of radar devices secured to the wearable device, wherein the set of radar devices (A) transmit radar signals to at least one transponder and (B) receive the radar signals, (3) an error-mitigation device secured to the wearable device, wherein the error-mitigation device provides data for mitigating position errors in triangulation calculations involving the radar signals, and (4) at least one processing device communicatively coupled to the set of radar devices and the error-mitigation device, wherein the processing device (A) calculates, based at least in part on roundtrip flight times of the radar signals and the data, distances between the set of radar devices and the transponder and (B) triangulates, based at least in part on the distances, a three-dimensional location of the transponder relative to the wearable device. Various other apparatuses, systems, and methods are also disclosed.},
