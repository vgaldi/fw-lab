	abstract= {Temporal metamaterials, based on time-varying constitutive properties, offer new exciting possibilities for advanced ﬁeld manipulations. In this study, we explore the capabilities of anisotropic temporal slabs, which rely on abrupt changes in time from isotropic to anisotropic response (and vice versa). Our ﬁndings show that these platforms can effectively manipulate the wave-spin dimension, allowing for a range of intriguing spin-controlled photonic operations. We demonstrate these capabilities through examples of spin-dependent analog computing and spin–orbit interaction effects for vortex generation. These results provide new insights into the ﬁeld of temporal metamaterials, and suggest potential applications in communications, optical processing and quantum technologies.}
