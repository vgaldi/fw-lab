abstract = "We apply the transformation-optics approach to the design of a metamaterial radome that can extend the scanning angle of a phased-array antenna. For moderate enhancement of the scanning angle, via suitable parameterization and optimization of the coordinate transformation, we obtain a design that admits a technologically viable, robust and potentially broadband implementation in terms of thin-metallic-plate inclusions. Our results, validated via finite-element-based numerical simulations, indicate an alternative route to the design of metamaterial radomes which does not require negative-valued and/or extreme constitutive parameters."
