abstract = "We investigate a class of multilayered metamaterials characterized by moderate-permittivity inclusions and low average permittivity. Via first-principles calculations, we show that in such a scenario, first- and second-order spatial dispersions may exhibit a dramatic and nonresonant enhancement, and may become comparable with the local response. Their interplay gives access to a wealth of dispersion regimes encompassing additional extraordinary waves and topological phase transitions. In particular, we identify a configuration featuring bound and disconnected isofrequency contours. Since they do not rely on high-permittivity inclusions, our proposed metamaterials may constitute an attractive and technologically viable platform for engineering nonlocal effects in the optical range."
