abstract: "Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a steplike temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultrafast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations."
