	abstract = {This chapter provides a compact review of recent results on the design and characterization of digital coding metasurfaces for the scattering-signature control. In particular, we theoretically derive some bounds to the reduction of the radar-cross-section based on a diffuse-scattering response, as well as some sub-optimal spatial coding strategies that are competitive with approaches based on brute-force numerical optimization but require negligible computational burden. We also explore the joint spatial-spectral field manipulations enabled by space-time coding for further reduction of the scattering signature. Finally, we illustrate and discuss some experimental results at microwave and terahertz frequencies that validate the proposed approach, and outline possible future developments in this research field.},
