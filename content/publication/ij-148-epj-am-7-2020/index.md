abstract = "Within the overarching framework of space-time metastructures, digital metasurfaces based on spatio-temporal coding are emerging as powerful and versatile architectures for complex ﬁeld manipulations, also in view of their inherently programmable nature. Here, we provide a compact survey of our recent results and ongoing studies in this research area. Examples of ﬁeld manipulations include harmonic beam steering and/ or shaping and programmable nonreciprocal effects. Possible applications are abundant and range from wireless communications to radars and imaging."
