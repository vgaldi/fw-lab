abstract = "In this paper, we present a new technique for determining the surface profile of a moderately rough interface between air and a homogeneous dielectric half-space. Based on sparsely sampled step-frequency ground penetrating radar measurements, the proposed inversion scheme uses a quasi-ray Gaussian beam fast forward model, coupled with a low-order parameterization of the surface profile in terms of B-splines. The profile estimation problem is posed as a parameter optimization problem, which is solved using a multiresolution continuation method via frequency hopping. Numerical experiments establish that the algorithm is efficient and yields accurate reconstructions throughout most of the illuminated region even in noisy environments, losing accuracy only in regions with very weak illumination."
