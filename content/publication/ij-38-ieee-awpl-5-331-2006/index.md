abstract = "This letter is concerned with a comparative study of the electromagnetic properties of two-dimensional, finite-size, aperiodically ordered “quasi-crystal” dielectric structures based on representative categories of “aperiodic-tiling” geometries. In this framework, a rigorous full-wave solver is used to explore the electromagnetic bandgap and directive radiation properties of potential interest in antenna applications."
