abstract = "We present a study of the lensing properties of two-dimensional (2-D) photonic quasicrystal (PQC) slabs made of dielectric cylinders arranged according to a 12-fold-symmetric square-triangle aperiodic tiling. Our full-wave numerical analysis confirms the results recently emerged in the technical literature and, in particular, the possibility of achieving focusing effects within several frequency regions. However, contrary to the original interpretation, such focusing effects turn out to be critically associated to local symmetry points in the PQC slab, and strongly dependent on its thickness and termination. Nevertheless, our study reveals the presence of some peculiar properties, like the ability to focus the light even for slabs with a reduced lateral width, or beaming effects, which render PQC slabs potentially interesting and worth of deeper investigation.
