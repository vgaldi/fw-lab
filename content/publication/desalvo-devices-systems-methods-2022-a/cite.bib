 abstract = {The disclosed computer-implemented method may include transmitting, by at least one radar device, a frequency-modulated radar signal to at least one transponder located within a physical environment surrounding a user, detecting, by a processing device communicatively coupled to the at least one radar device a signal returned to the at least one radar device from the at least one transponder in response to the frequency-modulated radar signal, determining a beat frequency of the returned signal by performing a zero-crossing analysis of the returned signal in the time domain, and calculating, based at least in part on the beat frequency of the returned signal, a distance between the at least one transponder and the at least one radar device. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable media are also disclosed.},
