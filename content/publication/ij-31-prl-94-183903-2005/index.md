abstract = "This Letter presents a study of the local density of states (LDOS) in photonic quasicrystals. We show that the LDOS of a Penrose-type quasicrystal exhibits small additional band gaps. Among the band gaps, some exhibit a behavior similar to that typical of photonic crystals, while others do not. The development of certain band gaps requires large-size quasicrystals. It is explained by the long-range interactions involved in their formation. Moreover, the frequencies where the band gaps occur are not necessarily explained using single scattering and should therefore involve multiple scattering."
