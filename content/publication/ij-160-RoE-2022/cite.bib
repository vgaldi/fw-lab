 abstract = {This Roadmap takes the reader on a journey through the research in electromagnetic wave propagation control via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. Meta-surface modelling and design methods are reviewed along with physical realisation techniques. Several wireless applications are discussed, including beam-forming, focusing, imaging, localisation, and sensing, some rooted in novel architectures for future mobile communications networks towards 6G.},
