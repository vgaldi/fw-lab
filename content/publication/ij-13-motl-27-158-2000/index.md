abstract = "A novel method for the systematic derivation of analytical approximations of the fundamental-mode dispersion equation and field distribution of graded-index planar waveguides with uniform cladding is presented. The method is based on a Stevenson-Pad√© approach, recently introduced by the authors for the numerical analysis of graded-index optical fibers. A number of examples are presented in order to illustrate the power and accuracy of the method."
