 abstract = {The disclosed computer-implemented method may include transmitting, by at least one radar device, to at least one transponder located within a physical environment surrounding a user, a frequency-modulated radar signal that has a first type of polarization, and receiving, by the at least one radar device, signals that have a second type of polarization, the second type of polarization being different than the first type of polarization, detecting, by a processing device communicatively coupled to the at least one radar device, a signal that has the second type of polarization and was returned to the at least one radar device from the at least one transponder in response to the frequency-modulated radar signal, and calculating, by the processing device, a distance between the at least one transponder and the at least one radar device. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable media are also disclosed.},
