abstract = "The research activities developed by five Italian academic partners (Universities of Roma Tre and “La Sapienza”, Sannio, Salerno, and Naples “Federico II”) in the frame of a PRIN 2006 research project, supported by the “Ministero dell’Università e della Ricerca,” are presented. The project involves theoretical investigation, numerical analysis, fabrication, and experimental characterization of metamaterials and (quasi-) periodic structures for applications in electronic devices and telecommunication systems. After a brief introduction about the main goals of the project, the scientific results achieved by the different research units will be detailed."
