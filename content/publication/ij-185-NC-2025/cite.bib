abstract = {Programmable metasurfaces (PMs), also called reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), are planar structures capable of dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves in real-time. Regarded as a key enabling technology for implementing smart wireless propagation environments, PMs/RISs also serve as an ideal supporting platform for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Here, we propose two ISAC schemes based on a special type of PMs/RISs: space-time-coding metasurfaces (STCMs). By leveraging space-time-coding strategies, STCMs simultaneously control the propagation at the fundamental (carrier) frequency for reliable wireless communication and generate spatially distributed harmonics for sensing. The proposed schemes seamlessly integrate both communication and sensing on a shared hardware platform, eliminating the need for additional sensors. For experimental validation, we implemented an ISAC system using a 2-bit STCM operating at microwave frequencies. Experimental results align with theoretical predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the proposed ISAC schemes for applications in communication, imaging, radar, and sensing systems.}
